# Budget Tools #

This is an andoid app that I created to help me track my expenses.
It currently comes with :

- Basic calculator
- Monthly summaries
- Connection to cloud firebase
- Google authentication

Future implementations include:
- User settings
- Summaries in day, week(s) or year
- Budget tracker
- Email, text summaries
